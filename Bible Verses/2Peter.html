From before the times of our ancestors, everything has remained the same since the world was first created.'" <br>[5] "They deliberately forget that God made the heavens long ago by the word of his command, and he brought the earth out from the water and surrounded it with water." <br>[6] "Then he used the water to destroy the ancient world with a mighty flood." <br>[7] "And by the same word, the present heavens and earth have been stored up for fire. They are being kept for the day of judgment, when ungodly people will be destroyed." <br>[8] "But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day." <br>[9] "The Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent." <br>[10] "But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment." <br>[11] "Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live, <br>[12] looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames." <br>[13] "But we are looking forward to the new heavens and earth he has promised, a world filled with God's righteousness." <br>[14] "And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living lives that are pure and blameless in his sight."</td>
